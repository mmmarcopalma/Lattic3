# Lattic3
The Lattic3 plugin for McNeel Rhinoceros-Grasshopper is a tool for the parametric modelling of diagrid-based lattice steel elements. Lattic3 designs rely on the performance of circular hollow steel sections, and provide equivalent structural inertia, while reducing material use. 

The software components are based on the Italian patent “Palo reticolare” (n. 102021000032411) and developed with the support of “Young Researchers” – Seal of Excellence 2022 grant - funded on D.M. 737/2021 resources-funded by European Union –“NextGenerationEU" (P.I. Vittoria Laghi, producer Marco Palma).

Lattic3 is compatible with Rhinoceros 8 SR 12 and successive releases, for both Windows and MacOS.
