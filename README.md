# Lattic3
Lattic3 is a plugin for the Rhinoceros-Grasshopper environment for the parametric modelling of diagrid-based lattice steel elements. Their design relies on the performance of circular hollow steel sections, providing equivalent structural inertia, but reducing material usage. 

The software components are based on the Italian patent “Palo reticolare” (n. 102021000032411) and developed with the support of “Young Researchers” – Seal of Excellence 2022 grant - funded on D.M. 737/2021 resources-funded by European Union –“NextGenerationEU" (P.I. Vittoria Laghi, producer Marco Palma).

Lattic3 is compatible with Rhinoceros 8 SR 12 and successive releases, for both Windows and MacOS.
